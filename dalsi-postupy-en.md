# Other open science practices

If you apply any of the following practices, please inform project administration.

## ORCID

Authors will create and maintain [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) and include it in their outputs when possible. 

<details markdown="1">

<summary>For MU: Linking IS and ORCID and transferring publication data</summary>

In order for publications entered in the IS to be displayed in your ORCID profile, you must grant MU consent in the section [Personal Identifiers (IS)](https://is.muni.cz/auth/publikace/identifikatory_osob). You can then choose which type of publications will be transferred, or select them manually in [Publications (IS)](https://is.muni.cz/auth/publications?orcid=1).

## Early access to research outputs 

### Preprints

Authors will share preprint versions of articles â€˜when relevantâ€™, unless this conflicts with the terms and conditions of the chosen journal. 

[Preprint servers registry ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers)

[Lingbuzz preprint server](https://lingbuzz.net/)

### Pre-registration of research 

Pre-registration of research (hypotheses, methodology) will ensure greater transparency. The feasibility study promised to use the platform [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/).

### Early access to data 

Sharing data in a trusted repository before article publication date. 

## Open peer-review

If a journal offers open peer-review, we should take advantage of this opportunity.   

## Publishing research reports 

Research reports will be assigned a persistent identifier, deposited in partners institutional repositories and linked on the project website.

## Citizen Science 

Citizen Science is the involvement of stakeholders other than scientists in the different phases of scientific research. This may include formulating the research question, designing methods, collecting and evaluating data, and presenting results. The involvement of citizen scientists is mentioned in the acknowledgements.
