# Open Access to publications (OA)

Open Access according to OP JAK is: 
- **Free** ‚Äì outcomes are freely available to end users
- **Unlimited** ‚Äì outcomes are reusable thanks to licenses 
- **Immediate** ‚Äì access is provided without time embargo

Mandatory OA for all publication outputs of the type: 
- **J, peer-reviewed article** ‚Äì includes article, review and letter 
- **B, peer-reviewed book**
- **C, chapter in a peer-reviewed book**
- **D, paper in proceedings**

For other types of outputs (**O, conference presentations, posters**), OA is recommended and welcome.

## Creative Commons licenses

For granting a license, the author must retain copyright ownership.

- [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license is necessary for accepting the article as a project output; it allows end users to use the work under the condition of attribution  
- More restrictive [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) or [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) licenses are only acceptable for longer texts (e.g. monographs) after justification; the NC clause allows only non-commercial use, ND allows use without modification (e.g. excludes translations of the work).

## How to proceed when publishing an article

### 1) Selecting a journal 

A) Publishing with a publisher that will make the publication available under a CC BY license.
- **Gold journal**: all articles are open after APC is paid 
- **Hybrid journal**: some articles are open after APC is paid 
- **Diamond journal**: all articles are open with no cost for the author

B) Publishing in a subscription-based journal and depositing the publication in a trusted repository under a CC BY license.

Acceptable versions for depositing: 
- Author Accepted Manuscript (version after peer-review)
- Version of Record (final version)

‚ùó Publishers have various conditions for uploading to repositories, which often include embargoes, the option to store only preprints, or only in institutional, non-commercial or closed repositories, or without granting a license. It is always necessary to familiarize yourself with the conditions before submitting an article. For assistance with selecting a journal and checking compliance with OA principles, please do not hesitate to contact OS support.

  <summary>How to pay the APC (Article Processing Charge)</summary> 

  The fees for opening an article are around EUR 3,000 (it can be much more) and project funds are allocated for this purpose. It is possible to take advantage of discounts thanks to agreements with publishers within the Czechelib project ‚Äì [instructions for authors](https://www.czechelib.cz/en/442-instructions-for-authors).
- For MU: Limited-number tokens are not allocated to project publications; discounts and fee waivers are available.

#### Characteristics of a compliant journal
 - Publisher's terms and conditions allow the author to retain copyright ownership.
 - The article will be published with a CC BY 4.0 license (in case of Gold, Hybrid or Diamond journal).
 - Publisher allows for the Author Accepted Manuscript or the final version of the article to be deposited in a repository under a CC BY 4.0 license immediately after publication (no embargo period).

### 2) Submitting the article 
Create a screenshot or archive the email communication to prove the date of submission. The date must be after the start of your contract with the project.

‚ùó If possible, opt for open peer review and publish a preprint.

The article must contain project acknowledgement:
    - This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund project ‚Äú A lifetime with language: the nature and ontogeny of linguistic communication (LangInLife) ‚Äù (reg. no.: CZ.02.01.01/00/23_025/0008726).

### 3) Article is accepted for publication
If the publisher's conditions allow, this can be done before the article is published ‚Äì in line with the principle of early access to results.

### 4) Article is published 
Depositing the appropriate version of the article to a trusted repository and creating a publication record for RIV (Czech register of scientific outcomes).

#### Recommended repositories for publications
- Institutional repositories: [Masaryk University](https://is.muni.cz/repozitar/?lang=en), [Charles University](https://dspace.cuni.cz/?locale-attribute=en), [Institute of Psychology of the Czech Academy of Sciences](https://asep.lib.cas.cz/arl-cav/en/search/)
