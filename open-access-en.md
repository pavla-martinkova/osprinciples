# Open Access to publications (OA)

Open Access according to OP JAK is: 
- **Free** ‚Äì outcomes are freely available to end users
- **Unlimited** ‚Äì outcomes are reusable thanks to licenses 
- **Immediate** ‚Äì access is provided without time embargo

Mandatory OA for all publication outputs of the type: 
- **J, peer-reviewed article** ‚Äì includes article, review and letter 
- **B, peer-reviewed book**
- **C, chapter in a peer-reviewed book**
- **D, paper in proceedings**

For other types of outputs (**O, conference presentations, posters**), OA is recommended and welcome.

## How to comply with the OA condition

### 1) Publishing with a publisher that will make the publication available under a CC BY license (Gold OA)
The publication must also be uploaded to a trusted repository with the same license immediately after the date of publication.

- **Gold journal**: all articles are open after APC is paid 
- **Hybrid journal**: some articles are open after APC is paid 
- **Diamond journal**: all articles are open with no cost for the author

  <summary>How to pay the APC (Article Processing Charge)</summary> 

  The fees for opening an article are around EUR 3,000 (it can be much more) and project funds are allocated for this purpose. It is possible to take advantage of discounts thanks to agreements with publishers within the Czechelib project ‚Äì [instructions for authors](https://www.czechelib.cz/en/442-instructions-for-authors).
- For MU: Limited-number tokens are not allocated to project publications; discounts and fee waivers are available.

### 2) Non-open publishing and depositing the publication in a trusted repository under a CC BY license (Green Road)

Acceptable versions for depositing: 
- Author Accepted Manuscript (version after peer-review)
- Version of Record (final version)

‚ùó Publishers have various conditions for uploading to repositories, which often include embargoes, the option to store only preprints or only in institutional, non-commercial, or closed repositories, or without granting a license. It is always necessary to familiarize yourself with the conditions before submitting an article. For assistance with selecting a journal and checking compliance with OA principles, please contact OS support. 

## How to proceed when publishing an article

### 1) Selecting a journal 
Getting acquainted with the terms and conditions of the publisher. Inform project administration about the potential cost of APC.

If possible, opt for open peer review.

### 3) Article is accepted for publication
